# KHar

We’re gonna make a raspberry-car that embodies the early technologies of automatic vehicles(line-tracking, light-tracking, avoiding obstacles). Also, using camera module to transmit images real-time. 
We used SUNFOUNDER smart video car kit, sourcecodes from SUNFOUNDER _Smart_Video_Car_Kit_for_RaspberryPi
